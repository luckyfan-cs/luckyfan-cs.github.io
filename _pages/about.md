I am Fan LIU, a research student at HKUST(GZ). My current interest is in trustworthy LLM, LLM for Reasoning and LLM-Powered Agents,  etc. My research papers  have been published in NeurIPS/KDD/ICMLW/TFS, etc.  For more details, please refer to [[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=w_T6VSsAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&gmla=AJsN-F6dCU5T7zqsidfpbWQ8dM-gnrcr_B7HR2Al0KB-Da0O4rcUVdg50B8s5frd_M45ZL6BePe8-CSTML8ov3F66_cbUYBgM835uoGWaepf8tveijtCUcc)]


Currently, I am particularly interested in building **trustworthy and effective  LLMs**, which I approach through three key aspects: **evaluation, foundational capabilities, and real-world applications**.

1. **LLM Evaluation**: Understanding the boundaries of LLMs, including their trustworthiness and reasoning capabilities. This involves assessing robustness, reliability, and alignment with human values.
Related paper: [[LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07191)],[[LLM Trustworthy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09324)]

2. **Enhancing Fundamental Capabilities**: Based on evaluation insights, I explore methods to improve **LLM trustworthiness and reasoning**, including **defending against jailbreak attacks, ensuring alignment with human values, and addressing fundamental challenges in logical reasoning and reflection**.
Related paper: [[Jailbreak Defense](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.06622)]

3. **LLM-Powered Agents and Applications**: Leveraging improved foundational capabilities to develop **trustworthy, real-world AI agents**. This involves studying agent alignment, decision-making, and adaptive interactions in dynamic environments.
Related paper: [[Mathematical Modeling Agent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14148)], [[Jailbreak Judge Agent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.12855)], [[Travel Planing Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08694)]

Through this structured approach, my research aims to bridge the gap between LLM evaluation, theoretical advancements, and practical deployment, ultimately contributing to the development of **more reliable and capable AI systems**.

<span style="color:red;">**News: The future of scientific discovery with Foundation Models!**</span>  
Foundation Models (FMs) like GPT-4 and AlphaFold are not just accelerating scienceâ€”they're reshaping it. Are they tools, or the architects of a new paradigm?  In our position paper, we propose a three-stage framework tracing this evolutionâ€”from augmenting current practices, to co-creating with humans, to enabling autonomous discovery.  Explore the vision, challenges, and roadmap at: [Awesome-Foundation-Models-for-Scientific-Discovery](https://github.com/usail-hkust/Awesome-Foundation-Models-for-Scientific-Discovery)
