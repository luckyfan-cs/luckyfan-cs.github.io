I am Fan LIU, a research student at HKUST(GZ).  Currently, my research focuses on LLM for automating scientific discovery, advancing LLM through alignment, modeling, and reasoning.  My research papers  have been published in NeurIPS/KDD/WWW/ECML PKDD/ICMLW/TFS, etc.  For more details, please refer to [[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=w_T6VSsAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&gmla=AJsN-F6dCU5T7zqsidfpbWQ8dM-gnrcr_B7HR2Al0KB-Da0O4rcUVdg50B8s5frd_M45ZL6BePe8-CSTML8ov3F66_cbUYBgM835uoGWaepf8tveijtCUcc)] If you are interested in my research, **feel free to reach out for discussions, collaborations, internship opportunities, or any related inquiries**.
